## Obsidian relativenumber Plugin

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin to enable relative line numbers (Ã  la Vim's
relativenumber).

Works in both Live Preview and legacy editor mode.

Please turn off the "Show line numbers" option in the main settings first.

Legacy mode borrows some code from the original [Relative Line Numbers plugin](https://github.com/nadavspi/obsidian-relative-line-numbers).
